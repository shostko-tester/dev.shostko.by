One of the biggest benefits to writing in Markdown is also one of its biggest curses when shipping content out for review and approvals: its syntax. Writers love Markdown for its simple, expressive syntax, but it is best suited for writing, not reading. Consuming markdown content is tedious and should never be part of an ongoing workflow. That's why Markdown editors (like the one in [Beegit](https://beegit.com)) come with a built-in preview mode designed for consuming content. Markdown content is written on the left side and rendered for reading on the right side. That's OK, but it's still designed for the writing process.

### What about an interface optimized for reading?

Today, we've rolled out a new feature to level up your team-based Markdown workflow and we're calling it the Project Portal. Now, each of your [Beegit](https://beegit.com) projects can be automatically indexed into a consumable, navigable, and _searchable_ website preview! You can enable/disable this feature from your project settings page. If enabled, just share the link to the Project Portal or file, and anyone can browse the content you've written in a rich interface. You can find the link using the share icon next to the file name.

<script src="//fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script>

Your stakeholders (clients, bosses, colleagues) can now read your content as intended, as rendered HTML output, without you having to worry about questions regarding Markdown syntax or having to export out a file just so it can be consumed. We've also included a project-wide content search in the Portal, so it's super easy to search across content and easily find related terms while browsing projects.

### Taking it a step further with file statuses and approvals

We've also included a simple file status and approval mechanism in this release. From the file menu, you can now manage a status on each file with notifications built right in. The supported file statuses are:

- Draft
- Pending Approval
- Approved

When changing the file status, you can optionally choose which collaborators on the project should be notified of the status change. If the Portal is enabled for that project, then the automated notification message will even direct them right to the Portal for an optimized reading experience. If the file status is "Pending Approval," the file can be approved directly from the Portal with an optimized approval interface. This helps to simplify an approval workflow by getting a stakeholder's sign-off on content without having to drag them through the Markdown. _Note: To approve a file, the approver will need to have a Beegit account and be logged in -- they can also log in from the Portal if they aren't already logged in._

We hope the new Portal and status features help make your life a little easier while writing and approving content. If you haven't been around for awhile, now is a great time to [log back in](https://beegit.com/login) to Beegit and see why it's the best collaborative writing app for the web. If you've never signed up for Beegit, it's the perfect time to [start a free trial](https://beegit.com/signup?plan=basic).

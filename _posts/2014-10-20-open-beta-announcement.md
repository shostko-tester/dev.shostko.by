Big things have been happening at Beegit, and we're excited to announce our open beta release today! 

We've been working hard throughout our closed beta to take feedback and make [Beegit](https://beegit.com/) better than ever. 

Now, the platform is open and anyone can [sign up](https://beegit.com/login) and start using Beegit immediately. 

To celebrate this release, we're giving you some fun features to help make your content process more productive. Here are some things you should try today. 

### A simplified, sortable, searchable dashboard
Sorting through your projects and the ones you collaborate on is easier than ever. Select a project owner and then search or sort through those projects by last modified, alphabet or color (see the next item). 

### Identify your projects by color
Give your projects a splash of color to help identify and sort teams or priorities. Pick a color in your project settings that will make it pop on your dashboard. 

### Comments worth @mentioning
Communicate to specific collaborators by @mentioning them in your comment. Start typing @ in your comment and see a list of your collaborators. Any you choose will get an email notification.

### Less notifications, more productivity
To follow a project closely, you can change your settings to receive an email every time a comment is made or a version is committed. Or, you can really keep a project moving with an @mention of specific people in your comment or version commit so they'll get an email directed at them. 

Take a [test drive of these features today](https://beegit.com/login). As always, if you have ideas for more features or any questions shoot us an [email](mailto:support@beegit.com).

We built Beegit with content creators in mind, and we hope you love it. This is a limited release of the software, and we're looking for feedback along the way on how to make Beegit the best tool for every content project. 

So if you've signed up for the beta, activate your [account now](https://beegit.com) and start your first project. Since you're part of our closed beta, you have an unlimited account. That means you can create as many projects as you need and you can add in unlimited team members. We can't wait to see what you create. 

Happy writing.

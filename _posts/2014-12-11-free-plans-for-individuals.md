Today is a great day to develop fresh content! 

### Beegit is here to help with our new free plan for individual users.

We built Beegit to be the best way for teams to write together, but we've been overwhelmed with requests from writers who wanted an individual plan so they could write all their content in Beegit. 

So we said, why not? Today, we updated our pricing plans to include a [free individual account](https://beegit.com/pricing). 

That's all we have for today. Have questions or want to see an updated demo of the software? Shoot us an [email](mailto:support@beegit.com) and we'll be happy to help.

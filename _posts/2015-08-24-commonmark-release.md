Today, we are excited to announce that Beegit's Markdown editor now supports <a href="http://commonmark.org" target="_blank">CommonMark</a> -- the standardized specification for Markdown. Additionally, we've added several new features that will make editing Markdown in Beegit more flexible than ever before.

### Why standardize Markdown?
Prior to creating a standard specification, user experiences have varied from application to application when writing and previewing Markdown. As a result, a number of key representatives from forward-thinking companies have invested in the advancement of Markdown. Companies like GitHub, Reddit, Stack Exchange and Meteor, as well as members from the open source community, are spearheading CommonMark's standardization effort to open it for further enhancements. Beegit feels that this movement is critical to the continued growth and adoption of Markdown.

### What this update means to you
**All of your current formatting inside Beegit will work seamlessly with the new update.** Additionally, this release has enabled us to unlock several new and exciting features that are available to you right now in the editor. Here's an overview of what's new:

### Emojis and emoticons
Ready to üòÄ? Emojis and emoticons are now natively supported inside Beegit. Simply type your favorite emoji code `:smile:` or emoticon `8-)` into the editor and it will render in the preview window -- it even exports to HTML. If you üíò emojis and emoticons as much as we do, you'll use this every day. Here's our favorite <a href="http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com" target="_blank">emoji cheat sheet</a> to get you started üöÄ.

### Embeddable content via iframes
The Beegit editor now supports iframes. This offers a new level of flexibility, allowing you to attach and preview resources like videos and executable code editors from around the web by placing them directly into your Markdown documents. We support codes from YouTube, Vimeo, JSFiddle and more.

### Checklists
You can now create checklists (or task lists) inside your Markdown files. Checklists render as clickable check boxes inside the preview window. Checklists are a great way to manage a task list for a file or project inside the application. Below is the convention for how to create checklists.

```
[ ] Unchecked item
```

```
[ ] Unchecked item
```

```
[X] Checked item
```

### Text highlighting
Quickly call attention to text in preview mode by wrapping the text you wish to highlight in double equal signs `==text you want to highlight==`. The wrapped text will get a bright "highlighter" effect behind it.

### Typographic replacements
We can now translate more ASCII punctuation and text characters into their symbol equivalents. Here's what is now supported:

* Straight quotes ( `"` and `'` ) get converted into ‚Äúcurly‚Äù quote symbols
* Dashes (`--` and `---`) get converted into en dash (--) and em dash (---) symbols
* Three consecutive dots (`...`) get converted into an ellipsis (‚Ä¶) symbol
* Text symbols `(C) (R) (TM) (P) +-` get converted into their respective symbols (¬© ¬Æ ‚Ñ¢ ¬ß ¬±)

You can always reference our [markdown cheat sheet](https://beegit.com/markdown-cheat-sheet) for more information on how to create Markdown or to see what is supported inside our application. There is also a version located inside our collaborative Markdown editor that can be quickly accessed via the Markdown Cheatsheet link, or by pressing `Ctrl/‚åòK`.

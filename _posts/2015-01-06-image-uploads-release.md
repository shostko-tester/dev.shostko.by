Whatever you're writing in [Beegit](https://beegit.com), we know you need images with it when publishing to the web. 

Well, good news, everyone! Our most recent update lets you upload images from your desktop or popular cloud storage services to a content delivery network.

**So now we host the uploaded images for you on a fast CDN, giving you the flexibility to use that link anywhere you need it on the web!**

This agile solution to your image hosting will give your users a faster load time, and your team will benefit from a centralized location for your images. 

To upload or import an image, simply click the picture icon in the toolbar of the editor. In the "Add Image" box, click "Choose an image" to upload an image from your desktop, or choose from services like Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, OneDrive, Instagram, Facebook, Flickr and Evernote. After the image uploads, we'll drop in the link to it right in your content.

Here's an image of how that process looks. Naturally, we uploaded this image to our Beegit project for this blog!

As always, you can also insert a link to an existing image that's already on the web by using the "Link to image" fields in the "Add Image" box, or by typing the necessary Markdown in the editor.

teaser: Beegit is the project management tool built specifically for content teams. So how are people using it? During our closed beta we asked a few organizations to share their workflow. One of the first to respond was Jessica, a marketing director for a cloud software company. She and her 11-person team recently used Beegit to rewrite their company's content for a website launch.

Beegit is the project management tool built specifically for content teams. 

It gives collaborators the ability to write and manage their content workflow in one spot, keeping everyone on the same page. It's adaptive content at its best - everything written is centralized and can be exported easily to web and print formats. 

So how are people using Beegit? During our closed beta we asked a few organizations to share their workflow. One of the first to respond was Jessica, a marketing director for a cloud software company. Her team uses Beegit to manage everything it writes - blogs, marketing documents and their website copy. 

She and her 11-person team recently used Beegit to rewrite their company's content for a website launch. Here's how they did it.

### Getting everybody on the same page. 

![Dashboard](https://s3.amazonaws.com/beegit-images/email/workflow/SSDashboard.png)

Every time her team has something to write, Jessica creates a new project Beegit. 

When she wanted to start writing copy for the new site, she created a project called "Website Content." Within that project she created files for all the pages on the site, like the home page, the products page, etc. By grouping everything together in this project, she had centralized visibility into everything written for the website whenever she wanted. 

Because this was a high priority, she highlighted the project color as red, which in her team's workflow, indicated a tight deadline for this content. Using project colors to assign priority worked well for her team, because they could easily find hot projects by sorting projects by color on their respective dashboards.

### Bringing in the team 

![Global Collaborators](https://s3.amazonaws.com/beegit-images/email/workflow/SSGlobalCollaborators.png)

Because her team writes a lot of content with Beegit, Jessica already had a collaborators list that set everyone to their usual role - observer, editor or administrator. These team members are automatically put on every new project she creates. 

This was a big project, though, so she wanted input from several members of the executive team. She added them all to this project as observers. That gave them power to comment on this project but didn't involve them in every piece of content the marketing team writes. 

### Writing and making a version

As her team put the copy together, everything they typed was autosaved and formatted in Markdown - a syntax ready for web and print. 

When her team hit a milestone - like when something was ready for approval - they made a version of their file or files. This version showed exactly what they added and deleted since the last version, so Jessica could quickly see where the project was going to make sure everything was on track. 

### Collaborating and making improvements

As the content came together, the right collaborators got involved - on demand. When a writer wanted to move their piece of content on to the next person for review or approval, they created a version and added an @mention. That sent a notification to the right person letting them know it was time to act. 

As work was being reviewed, people made inline comments and included @mentions to ask the right people about issues or questions in the content that needed attention. 

### Keeping a pulse on the project

Throughout this process, Jessica was able to check in on the project as a whole or any individual file. When she wanted to see every detail come together, she subscribed to notification emails for every mention and comment on the project. 

She could also see metrics on content creation that told her how much was being done and let her know if her team was putting the right priority on this project. If she had questions about where any team member's progress stood, she reviewed the version history to see their most recent milestones.

### Moving the content to production

Because the content created in Beegit was adaptive, it quickly exported into HTML and was placed into the new site once it was approved. 

### Learning and improving 

![Metrics](https://s3.amazonaws.com/beegit-images/email/workflow/SSMetrics.png)

After the new site was up, Jessica used Beegit to learn from the project. She had metrics that showed when her team was most productive and who carried the heaviest writing load. She could also see the full version history to identify what prompts or questions led the content to completion. All of this made her and her team smarter for their next content project. 

### Keeping content safe and ready to be used again 
After the content was put on the site, the final version was kept in Beegit for future use. Whether her company decides to change sites, wants to use the content for social media, or decides to use it for their print materials, Jessica has a way to make it accessible to the right team members at any time.

As you can probably tell from the headline, big things have happened in our Cleveland headquarters in 2015, and big things often require a name change.

So, today we're announcing that Beegit's content services division is now <a href="http://ngagecontent.com" target="_blank">NgageContent</a>.

[Beegit](https://beegit.com/) will remain as a standalone product. It continues to provide us with opportunities we never expected. Because it puts us directly in the inbound marketing workflow of so many organizations, more and more of our customers have come to us looking for help beyond content creation.

The goal is to connect all of the inbound marketing pieces -- moving from initial inbound strategy through execution and measurement. We know how to help with this goal, which has led to us working with our customers to set up inbound marketing systems that include a complete strategy and technology implementation.

As we've followed this path, we've realized that what we really are is a marketing technology and solutions company. Sounds fancy, right? So what does that mean?

Marketing automation tools continue to pop up for every part of the inbound funnel, and putting them together has become a gargantuan task. Working as NgageContent, we'll use our inbound strategy and Beegit, along with other marketing technology solutions to build the marketing stacks for growing B2B companies. With our technology expertise, we are able to fill in the gaps across our customers' marketing implementations.

### What about Beegit?
While this formalizes things that have been happening in our headquarter office throughout 2015, it does not change the fact that Beegit's collaborative writing app will continue to serve content teams. From big companies like Stratasys, CenturyLink, Telerik and OverDrive to many medium and niche agencies across the world, Beegit is baked into hundreds of daily workflows. We are forever appreciative of that opportunity and we still have a huge desire to provide a tool that drives their businesses.

Beegit will continue to receive regularly scheduled updates from our development team. In fact, [we just had a big workflow release](http://blog.beegit.com/platform/2015/11/30/optimize-your-markdown-writing-workflow/) featuring our new approval portal and easy-to-use draft statuses.

For teams with a need for a collaborative Markdown workflow, we still think that it's the best product on the market and we have plans to greatly improve it throughout 2016.

So that's our exciting update to end 2015.

People are writing more content than ever in the Beegit editor, so we've released a handy new find/replace feature. The project search feature has also been upgraded to support searching for files.

### Find and replace

You can use the new find and replace feature in the file editor to search within an open file. Bring up the find/replace panel with `CMD+F` (Mac) or `CTRL+F` (PC) whenever your cursor is focused in the editor. From there, you'll be notified of how many matches are found in your document based on your query. You can then cycle through the matches, or use the replace feature to easily make sweeping changes across the whole file. You can close the panel with the `ESC` key when you're done.

### Upgraded search capabilities

For a while now, [you've been able to search across all projects](http://blog.beegit.com/platform/2015/08/04/improved-collaboration/) that you have access to by searching for the project name. That search has now been upgraded to search across all files that you have access to as well (given a search query, it'll try to find both projects and files that match). Now it is easier than ever to use the search feature to jump between files in different projects without having to use the file navigation to open a file. For now, this search will query against all filenames in projects that you can access (stay tuned for more on this later if you want to be able to search file content as well ðŸ˜‰).

**_Update: As of February 5, 2016, file searches now search actual file content as well as filenames._**

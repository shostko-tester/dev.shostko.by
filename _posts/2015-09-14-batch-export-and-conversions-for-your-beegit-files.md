One of the great benefits to writing content in Markdown is that it can be easily translated to many different formats -- if you're using a good conversion tool. [Beegit](https://beegit.com) has supported file conversions from Markdown to `HTML`, `Word`, `InDesign`, and `ePub` formats since its inception, one file at a time (in addition to the [compile feature](http://blog.beegit.com/platform/2015/02/27/publish-and-compile/), which stitches Markdown files together into a single output file).

Today, we're excited to announce batch file exporting and conversions. From any [Beegit](https://beegit.com) project, you can now export and convert batches of files in a single click by choosing a folder and selecting an export format (you can export the entire project by selecting the `Project Files` folder). We'll automatically export and convert your files and download them for you in a zip file, right in the web browser. The zip file will retain the folder structure you selected, so you can get right to work on the files on your desktop, or wherever you're shipping them off to.

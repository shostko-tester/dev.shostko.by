Collaborative content development can be tricky. Keeping everyone on the same page takes a lot of communication. 

At Beegit, teams have shared that pain with us, and we're looking to make writing together easy. Today, we're simplifying team communication with comment replies and resolves. 

Our platform already gives users the ability to [make inline comments](/new_features/2014/10/07/inline-comments-release/), helping people tie context to their thoughts. 

Now, you can reply to a comment, keeping relevant conversations inside a thread. These comments will be tied to the same text and will float into position when you click on the highlighted text. 


Once the conversation around that comment is settled, you can also resolve a comment made by you or another user so that it doesn't clog up your editor view.
